# Data_compression_using_huffmancode

Huffman Coding Implementation in C++
📌 Introduction
This project implements Huffman Coding, a lossless data compression algorithm that reduces the size of text using variable-length codes based on character frequencies.

🔍 How It Works
Frequency Calculation: Counts occurrences of each character in the input string.

Priority Queue Construction: Builds a min-heap to create Huffman Tree nodes.

Tree Formation: Combines nodes recursively based on frequency to form a binary tree.

Encoding & Decoding:

Generates unique binary codes for characters.

Compresses and decompresses text using the Huffman tree.

🚀 Features
Efficient compression algorithm.

Encoding and decoding support.

Uses priority queues for optimal node selection.

Written in C++ using standard libraries.
